Taiwan’s Open Government Data Platform has been upgraded, underscoring the government’s commitment to improving administrative transparency and promoting civic participation, according to the Cabinet-level National Development Council Jan. 9.
 
The upgraded platform now has an interactive section to easily facilitate citizen requests for information while providing real-time responses, with more detailed requests forwarded to government agencies, the NDC said. Providing even easier access to public data will increase administrative transparency and efficiency, it added.
 
According to the council, the platform now features a user-friendly search implementation thanks to a collaboration between the NDC and Data Application Helper—one of the winning teams in the 2019 Presidential Hackathon.
 
The NDC said it is committed to further improving the amount and variety of data provided on the platform through working with government agencies, industry and civic groups, adding that users will be provided with an explanation for any materials that cannot be made public.
 
Launched by the NDC in 2013, the Open Government Data Platform is designed to provide citizens with quick and easy access to public records while increasing understanding of Taiwan’s system of governance.
