Automotive Research & Testing Center (ARTC), the most important transportation-vehicle testing and R&D institute in Taiwan, unveils Taiwan's first indigenous self-driving pure-electric minibus-WinBus-a demonstration of local autonomous-vehicle R&D and supply-chain capability. The WinBus achieves the capability of SAE Level 4 autonomous-driving (high-automation) standard. In fixed or closed fields, the WinBus can fully accomplish all environment-monitoring and self-driving tasks without human intervention. The Made-in-Taiwan (MIT) minibus is an integration of more than 20 suppliers in local supply chain, including chassis, powertrain, battery, body, and key systems for sensing, decision-making, network connection etc.
