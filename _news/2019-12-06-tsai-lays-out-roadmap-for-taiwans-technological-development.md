President Tsai Ing-wen said Dec. 5 that the government will spare no efforts in promoting the space industry and setting up a dedicated agency to coordinate Taiwan’s digital development, ensuring the country maintains its position as a global innovation leader.
 
Technological prowess continues to drive Taiwan’s economic growth, with various government initiatives delivering real-world results and making the country one of only four super innovators in the world as per the World Economic Forum, the president said.
 
To meet the challenges and opportunities ahead, Tsai said the Cabinet has approved a 10-year, NT$25.1 billion (US$823 million) space industry development project to support local businesses, fast-track talent cultivation and promote cross-border cooperation.
 
Tsai made the remarks during the opening of the Future Tech Expo in Taipei City. Organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the four-day exhibition is expected to attract more than 100,000 visitors from home and abroad and create NT$1 billion in business.
 
The event is showcasing more than 100 technological breakthroughs by Taiwan enterprises in 11 major fields including artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, biotechnology, medical devices, revolutionary materials and smart machinery.
 
According to Tsai, Taiwan is poised to become a key R&D and production center for satellite components and parts, ground receiving equipment and other supportive systems for the space industry thanks to its competitive advantages in information and communication technology and semiconductors, as well as its comprehensive information security infrastructure.
 
Tsai also said plans are being made to create a dedicated agency supervising government policies involving ICT, information security, networking and telecommunication. The new entity will be tasked with coordinating digital infrastructure development, ensuring orderly market competition and promoting related applications, she added.
 
These efforts will help Taiwan remain a center of advanced manufacturing and R&D in Asia, Tsai said, adding that the country seeks to play a key role in the future of space exploration and global technological development.
