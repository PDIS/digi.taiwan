National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Taiwan, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with TEPCO Power Grid, Incorporated, Japan, on June 15th, for strengthening the industry-academia linkage and developing a clean energy future in Asia.

NCKU President Huey-Jen Jenny Su and TEPCO Power Grid Managing Director Mr. Shinichi Imai signed the MoU on behalf of the respective organizations.

President Su welcomed the over-40-member Japanese energy delegation led by Shinichi Imai and hailed the signing of MoU, expressing optimism that this is a good beginning for future cooperation.

The MoU will pave the way for cooperation initially for a three-year period. The partnership will explore innovations in energy and pursue mutual objectives of starting virtual power plant business, energy data application services and smart community development in Taiwan.
Under the MoU, the two parties will start to co-work a smart community verification project in Shalun Smart Ecological City.

In response to Taiwan governmentâ€™s 2025 non-nuclear home policy, President Su said,
NCKU has continued its momentum in energy technology research, urban planning, and smart healthcare application and then aspired to ally with top institutions in Asian region to look into the future of sustainable and smart eco-city.

NCKU invited TEPCO PG, the largest electric power group in Japan, to establish a collaboration and further its experience in equipment planning, construction, and dispatching applications in the power transmission and distribution business, as well as the promotion of energy information application services. 

Currently, Japan achieved a fully liberalized electricity market. This process has led to a rising proportion of renewable energy in Japan and a higher energy efficiency. It has become a society with a high awareness of energy conservation while the power structure in Taiwan has been greatly affected by Japan. 

Today, NCKU and TEPCO Power Grid have formed alliances and the strategic partnership from now on will serve as a core for energy transformation to jointly develop the next generation of energy technologies and applications.
