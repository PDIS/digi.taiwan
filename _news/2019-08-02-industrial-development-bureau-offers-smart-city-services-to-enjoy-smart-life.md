The Board of Science and Technology (BOST) of the Executive Yuan convened the 8th Meeting of the Smart City Taiwan Communication Platform on July 24, 2019 to utilize the experience of developing smart services, and engage in greater depth of exchanges with county/city governments. The core members of the meeting included central government agencies and the 22 counties/cities participating in the Smart City Program of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).

Chang Yu-chuan, president of Fashion Intelligence Co., Ltd., shared the implementation experience in the “Active Aging Protection, Peace is a Blessing” Project of Pingtung County. He explained how to use Bluetooth and sensor technologies to effectively prevent the elderly from becoming lost, allowing the elderly to feel at ease when they go out. The company not only linked together over 200 blood pressure measurement stations, healthcare institutions, and convenience stores in Pingtung County, but also protective talismans from local temples, creating a warm service experience for the elderly.

Hu Tsung-hsien, section chief at LITE-ON Technology Corporation, shared the joint telemedicine project in Lienchiang County Hospital with Taipei City Hospital, featuring integrated video consultation, medical record sharing via blockchain, and domestically produced medical instruments to support offshore islands with insufficient medical resources. Specialists provide healthcare services at fixed times and places, resolving the issue of offshore islands having insufficient medical resources. Patients with chronic illnesses that need long-term care at home can also receive better healthcare, making it more convenient for residents to seek medical attention.

With regard to smart transportation, Chen Ching-hsiang, president of Wan Da Tong Enterprise Co., Ltd., shared the smart mobile ticketing service of Taipei Bus Station, which was developed to resolve the issue of passengers waiting in long lines during the holidays to buy tickets. Starting in August this year (2019), the company first worked with Ubus, Alohatransport, and Ho-Hsin to provide a smartphone ticketing app, integrating inquiry, reservation, payment, retrieval, refund, and inspection services. Users only need to select the origin, destination and time of the bus to see the number of seats remaining and ticket prices of multiple bus companies. They can then select a seat, complete payment, retrieve their ticket, and go on the bus and have their ticket inspected.

In addition, Taoyuan City, which won the 2019 Intelligent Community of the Year (Top 1) from the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF), was also invited to share its experience in promoting smart services. Chief Secretary Yen Chun-ju explained how Taoyuan used its unique features to work with the MOEA in the Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan and Smart City Program.

Executive Secretary Tsai Chih-hung of the BOST stated during the meeting that the development of smart city applications should provide an idea what society and life will be like 20 or 30 years in the future, and let government and industry jointly realize the vision for people to live a good life through the Smart City Taiwan Program.
