Bearing the theme of "Startup High 5ive," the Meet Taipei Startup Festival 2018 running November 15-17 at Taipei Expo Dome highlights close combination of Taiwan startup teams and further connections with international startup ecosystems to create Taiwan's new wave of startup development in the next five years.

Through six major themed industrial exhibit areas and international startup exhibit zone, the event has gathered 200 domestic startup teams, 100 international startup firms from 23 countries and witnessed a series of forums and many other activities such as NeoStar Demo Show, DigiAsia 2018, and La French Touch, all designed to showcase Taiwan's solid prowess and momentum in tech innovations.

Many iconic representatives from related sectors at home and abroad attended the opening session, including Audrey Tang, a Taiwan minister without portfolio, StarFab CEO Amanda Liu, Advantech investor representative WT Liu, KKDay founder MM Chen, and representatives from American Institute in Taiwan and Austrian Commercial Office in Taiwan.

A National Development Council official said at the opening ceremony that the government is relaxing relevant regulations and offering incentives to solicit more tech talents and encourage investment in setting up tech startups in Taiwan.

An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs also noted that the ministry is implementing a Service Industry Innovation Research (SIIR) program to help startups in diverse fields with market researches, and that the Company Law has been revised to allow more flexibility for business operations by startups.

Among industrial players at the event, Advantech greatly encourages startup teams to engage in innovations and the company hopes to co-create the next wave of IoT business opportunities with startup partners by providing related solutions through its WISE-PaaS IoT platform.
