President Lai Ching-te pledged to continue advancing research and development of information security products and services while encouraging related investment to upgrade cybersecurity across the board.

Lai made the remarks while attending the Cyberssec 2025 opening ceremony April 15 in Taipei City.

This year’s edition, themed “Team Cybersecurity,” has brought together global experts and representatives from more than 400 international cybersecurity brands to share their experiences and deepen mutual exchanges, the president said, adding that the ongoing three-day event involves over 300 speeches and has drawn an estimated total of over 20,000 participants.

According to the Presidential Office, prominent guests included Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, and other members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Taiwan.

As digital threats continue to escalate, individuals and organizations cannot face the challenge alone, Lai said. By joining forces, participants can help build a robust global cybersecurity network that meets the digital defense needs of all, he added.

The president noted that following his inauguration last May, he established a Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, inviting civil groups and specialists to take part to reinforce the security of financial networks, key infrastructure, telecommunications and transportation.

Lai said that last month he proposed an additional 17 national security strategies and requested government agencies to take proactive measures to prevent hackers from accessing domestic information.

The president went on to say that the 2025 national strategy for information security was officially announced last week, and an initiative to strengthen domestic information safety has also been devised for the years 2025-2028.

The four-year project focuses on three main goals: strengthening societal information security resilience, enriching the information security industry ecosystem and forging new defense technologies, Lai said, adding that the Ministry of Digital Affairs is amending the Cyber Security Management Act to ensure more comprehensive protection.

The president concluded by thanking industry leaders for their investment and contributions and said he looked forward to working together to jointly safeguard information security and spur development across all sectors.
