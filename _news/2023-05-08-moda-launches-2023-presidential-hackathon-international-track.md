The Ministry of Digital Affairs officially launched the 2023 Presidential Hackathon International Track May 5 in Taipei City, urging those of all backgrounds to submit innovative ideas for data applications aimed at improving people’s lives and promoting new governance methods.
 
Organized by the Executive Yuan and implemented by the moda under the supervision of the Presidential Office, the fifth edition of the event is themed “Free the Future: Open, Digital and Green.” The theme syncs with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the moda said.
 
During the launch ceremony, Digital Minister Audrey Tang said the time is ripe for new ways of inclusive conflict resolution based on co-creation and enhanced communication to address geopolitical tensions that impact all. This farsighted approach underscores the moda’s commitment to promoting participatory policymaking and transitioning to a net-zero world, she added.
 
Open data and technology are key to bringing people together to tackle shared challenges, Tang said, adding that it is also important to reach consensus among different groups to develop viable solutions.
 
Other high-profile attendees of the event included Ambassadors Andrea Clare Bowman from St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Robert Kennedy Lewis from St. Lucia; Carlos Jose Fleitas Rodriguez from Paraguay; and Donya Lynex Francis from St. Kitts and Nevis.
 
According to the moda, the competition is accepting entries until May 31. Any team of up to five members can enter as long as the group includes at least one person who is not an ROC (Taiwan) citizen, it added.
 
Selections will be evaluated on feasibility, influence and innovativeness, the ministry said, adding that the results of initial review will be announced by June 30.
 
Launched in 2019, the hackathon’s international track has solicited creative contributions from 147 teams representing 34 countries to date. It helps foster cross-border, interdisciplinary, and public-private collaboration to gather potential societal solutions that satisfy the developmental needs of nations worldwide.
