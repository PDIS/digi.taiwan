Taiwan could start launching large satellites from within the country in 2026, Science and Technology Minister Wu Tsung-tsong (吳政忠) said Thursday (March 17).

Facing questioning at the Legislative Yuan, the minister said he hopes construction of a base could start in east or southeast Taiwan in 2024, with work to be completed in 2025 and the first launch scheduled for 2026, CNA reported.

At present, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) manages a launch center for small rockets in the Pingtung County village of Hsuhai near the southeast coast. Major satellites are launched overseas, however, mostly in the United States.

Due to Taiwan’s geographical restrictions, the MOST is already looking for a site in eastern or southeastern areas closer to the equator, Wu said. The ministry is focusing on finding just one location, but Hsuhai is not suitable because of its limited space. The National Space Organization has also said 2026 will be the year locally made satellites can be launched from Taiwan.
