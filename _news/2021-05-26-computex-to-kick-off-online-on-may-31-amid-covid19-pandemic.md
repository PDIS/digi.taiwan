Taiwan's Computex 2021, one of the world's biggest computer and technology trade shows, is scheduled to start online only on May 31, as the country deals with an escalation of domestically-transmitted COIVID-19 cases, an organizer said Wednesday.

The government-sponsored Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), one of the exhibition's organizers, told reporters that Simon Segars, CEO of the U.K.-based semiconductor supplier ARM Ltd., will deliver an online keynote speech titled "Sparking the World's Post-Pandemic Recovery" on May 31 to launch the virtual event, which is scheduled to run through June 30.

Amid concerns over the spread of the pandemic, the organizers announced at the end of March that the physical part of Computex would be cancelled. Instead the trade show will focus on online events to facilitate tailor-made interactions between exhibitors and visitors through artificial intelligence and automation technologies.

With the assistance of these emerging technologies, TAITRA said visitors to the trade show from home and abroad will obtain information about new products from exhibitors worldwide.

In addition to Segar's keynote speech, TAITRA said Lisa Su (蘇姿丰), president and CEO of semiconductor brand Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc., and Kurt Sievers, President and CEO of IC supplier of NXP Semiconductors NV. will give speeches online on the latest AI, high performance computing applications around the world by June 2.

TAITRA said 2021 Computex will include the Computex Forum from June 2-3 where specialists from all over the world will discuss modern industrial development with a focus on AI, 5G, the Internet of Things (IOT) and electronics vehicle technologies.

TAITRA has also added InnoVEX, a special exhibition featuring start-ups from around the world, which will also be highlighted at the upcoming Computex with strong support from firms that come from countries such as France, the Netherlands and South Korea.

Moreover, TAITRA said the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will lead a delegation comprised of 17 start-ups from seven European countries to open a special pavilion at InnoVEX.

Among the exhibitors at Computex, Taiwanese PC brand Acer Inc. will demonstrate its newest products and display solutions in smart city, AI development and for enterprises use, the organizer said.

In addition, the Taipei-based Epoch Foundation, set up by the government, academic circles and the business sector, will showcase AI, big data, digital medicare and education technologies, the organizer added.
