Premier Lai Ching-te on Friday hosted the first in a series of exchanges with business leaders aimed at gathering views and suggestions in order to shape a more responsive government. The meeting with startup entrepreneurs at Taipei’s Syntrend Creative Park demonstrated the government’s support for startups, said the premier, who framed the exchange as a chance for business people to better understand policy and for the government to listen to the concerns of the business community. Such cooperation will help Taiwan’s startup companies compete in the global arena.

Because supporting startup enterprises is an important objective, said Premier Lai, the government has put into place an action plan for improving the environment for investing in startups by ensuring sufficient early-stage capital, fostering talent and fine-tuning laws and regulations, developing a positive partnership with startup companies, providing exits for startup investors, and helping startups conquer global markets.

Taiwan has a plentiful pool of technology talent, said the premier, as well as comprehensive laws and regulations governing intellectual property rights. After decades of dedicated effort, Taiwan has developed a solid foundation in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, the internet of things and virtual reality. These capabilities can now be harnessed by young people to develop their own space for growth and achievement.

Following the exchange between the premier and entrepreneurs, a number of agencies and ministries followed up with answers to questions raised. The premier also provided encouragement for a group of 12 startups scheduled to travel to the U.S. to take part in business and trade events.
