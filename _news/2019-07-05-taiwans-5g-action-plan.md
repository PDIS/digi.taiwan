On May 10, 2019, the Executive Yuan approved an action plan for 5G technology in Taiwan. The four-year plan will run from 2019 to 2022, during which an estimated NT$20.466 billion (US$657.9 million) will be invested. With the imminent arrival of the new 5G mobile communications era and to capitalize on the technology’s immense business potential, the plan calls for the adoption of several strategies—including deregulation, innovation, proofs of concepts, and forging connections—to devotedly pursue the development of all manner of 5G value-added communications services along with vertical applications. The ultimate goal is to build Taiwan into a suitable environment conducive to innovative uses of 5G, which in turn will increase the nation’s digital competitiveness, entrench industrial innovation, and realize a way of life enmeshed with smart technology.

Five pillars of the plan

◆ Establish areas for testing vertical 5G applications: Public and private entities will work together to set up sites across Taiwan to test a diverse combination of applications. Rules and regulations will also be relaxed in order to expand the scope and operational modes of applications that can be tested.

◆ Engineer an environment conducive to innovative 5G applications: A platform for cooperation across multiple industries will be constructed to support new 5G businesses, as well as draw into the market enterprises from a wide selection of sectors. Talent proficient in 5G technology and applications will be fostered through a full range of channels to meet the growing demands of the 5G industry.

◆ Perfect core 5G technologies and cybersecurity: Superior core techniques will be devised, together with the promotion of application technology integration and the establishment of a platform for enhancing and testing 5G capabilities. Future objectives include a unified national policy for 5G cybersecurity, protective mechanisms to secure domestically produced 5G products, and a strengthening of skills to defend critical 5G infrastructure and operational cybersecurity.

◆ Plan for the release of 5G spectrum that will best serve overall interests: An encompassing 5G spectrum policy will be thoroughly planned out in accordance with industry requirements, market trends, and international developments. The auction of 5G frequencies will proceed in stages to allow for revisions, comprehensive preparations and eventual release of spectrum.

◆ Adjust laws and regulations to create an environment beneficial to the development of 5G: On May 29, 2019, the Legislature passed a law to manage telecommunications that will drastically lower the barriers to market entry and provide the flexibility for cooperation across industries. The result will promote the joint construction of basic 5G infrastructure and shared use by all.
