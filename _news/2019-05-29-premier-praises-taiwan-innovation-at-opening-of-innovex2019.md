Premier Su Tseng-chang on Wednesday attended the opening of InnoVEX 2019, where he commented that in 2018’s Global Competitiveness Report, the World Economic Forum ranked Taiwan alongside Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland as the world’s top four innovating economies. This recognition, he said, also comes with international affirmation and appreciation of the strong protections Taiwan affords patents and other intellectual property. The premier further expressed the government’s hope that by leveraging the scale of on-going parent show COMPUTEX, the startup-oriented InnoVEX 2019 would serve as an international showcase for Taiwan’s globe-leading innovative capabilities.

The Taipei Computer Association said that 2019 marks the fourth InnoVEX exhibition, and organizers have adopted “New Thinking, New Engineering, New Future” as this year’s slogan. From today’s grand opening until closing on May 31, InnoVEX is featuring 467 foreign and domestic startups from 25 countries and regions at the Taipei World Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1, where the focus has been on amazing new innovations in artificial intelligence, applications of the “internet of things,” health and wellness, and biotechnology.
