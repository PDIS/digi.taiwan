The upcoming Digital Innovation Forum 2018 is drawing global heavyweights in the field to Taipei, including former Estonia President Toomas Henrik Ilves, whose country is recognized as one of the world's leaders in digitization.

The APEC Business Advisory Council-sponsored forum, jointly organized by Taiwan and Papua New Guinea, is being held July 19-20 at the Taipei International Convention Center and will focus on artificial intelligence, scientific and financial technology, and digital innovation.

Ilves will be among 36 speakers at the forum, a group that will also include Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales; Christ Anderson, author of the 2006 book "The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More;" and Sophia, the world's first Android citizen.

Sophia will converse with Ethan Tu (杜奕瑾), founder of Taiwan A.I. Labs, and former Evernote CEO Phil Libin on the topic of exploring 100 possibilities of AI and mankind creating cultures together, according to the organizers.

To be hosted by PChome Online Chairman Jan Hung-tze (詹宏志), the forum is expected to attract more than 1,000 people from 21 member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic and Cooperation (APEC) forum, the organizers estimated.

"We aim to bring substantial influence to the development of global digital innovation," the organizers said on the forum's website.

"By decoding the latest technology, we are here to stimulate creativity, break through the barriers of technology, discover the chasm caused by digitalization and unveil the upcoming opportunities that lie within," they said.

Ilves served as the fourth president of Estonia from 2006 until 2016. During his tenure, he drove the initiatives in e-government and cybersecurity for which the country has been acknowledged as a world leader.

In the Global Cybersecurity Index for 2017, Estonia ranked fifth in the world after Singapore, the United States, Malaysia and Oman, and first in Europe in the field of cybersecurity.

The Baltic country, named the most advanced digital society in the world by specialist tech magazine Wired, is the place where telecommunications application software Skype was invented and unicorn startup companies like Playtech, TransferWise and Taxify, each valued at US$1 billion or more, were born.
