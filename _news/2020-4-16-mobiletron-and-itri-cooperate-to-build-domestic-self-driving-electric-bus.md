Following the trial run at Shuinan Smart City Taichung, ITRI joined hands with industry players to seize business opportunities in the self-driving market! ITRI announced the signing of a smart cooperation with Mobiletron on January 27. The two parties will jointly build 10 domestic self-driving electric buses by 2021. 

The first trial production self-driving electric bus that is expected to be available at the first quarter of 2020. In the future, it will be cooperate with local bus operators for testing in the specific areas. This is the largest self-driving bus production and research cooperation case in Taiwan in recent years, integrating 14 domestic automotive electronics equipment, and hardware and software manufacturers, such as motors, meters, systems, sensors, HD map, and security. We hope to build a domestic autonomous driving industry chain and cut into the first-tier supply chain of international automakers.
