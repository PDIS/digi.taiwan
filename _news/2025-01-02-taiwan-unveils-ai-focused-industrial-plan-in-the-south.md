Taiwan's Executive Yuan (行政院) approved the "Greater Southern New Silicon Valley Promotion Plan" (大南方新矽谷推動方案) on Thursday (Jan. 2), aiming to create an AI-centered industrial ecosystem in southern Taiwan. The plan will integrate the "Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City" (SSGESC, 沙崙智慧綠能科學城) with semiconductor corridors spanning Chiayi (嘉義) to Pingtung (屏東), focusing on AI industrialization.

The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC, 國科會) plans to establish a computing power center in Shalun with a projected budget of NT$36 billion over five years. Wu Cheng-wen (吳誠文), the Executive Yuan's political committee member and the council's chair, will lead this flagship regional initiative.

The council outlined four strategic pillars: expanding computing power, linking fields, attracting talent, and showcasing applications. The plan aims to inject AI technology across industries, fostering a smart transformation and advancing Taiwan's AI capabilities from research to system development.

NSTC Vice Chair Su Chen-kang (蘇振綱) emphasized the necessity of establishing a robust computing power center. The plan will also enhance living conditions and infrastructure in southern Taiwan, focusing on housing, education, transportation, and healthcare.
