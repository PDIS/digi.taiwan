At Thursday's weekly Cabinet meeting, Premier Cho Jung-tai was briefed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on an "intelligent rainforest" industrial revitalization program. To advance President Lai Ching-te's policy vision of transforming Taiwan into an "AI island," the premier said that the government's plan to promote a new Silicon Valley in southern Taiwan should serve as a foundational and pilot platform for the "intelligent rainforest" program, which will subsequently be expanded to other counties and cities. The program will address common industry needs by leveraging the expertise of colleges and universities, focusing on representative areas and building replicable innovation models. It will also facilitate AI integration and digital transition to increase operational efficiency and reduce production costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These efforts will accelerate the upgrading and transformation of industries in southern Taiwan, foster a resilient and scalable innovation ecosystem, drive regional prosperity and enable practical implementation of new technologies.

Premier Cho emphasized that the program should be advanced in tandem with the government's policy of creating smart living environments for all. Together, these initiatives will actively promote smart medicine, smart dining, smart manufacturing, and various other projects to introduce smart conveniences into everyday life, thereby extending AI applications across a wide range of industries, spurring innovation and ensuring inclusive access to the technology.
