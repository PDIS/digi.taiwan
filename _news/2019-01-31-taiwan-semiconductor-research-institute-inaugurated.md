The Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute (TSRI), a merger of the National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL), the National Chip Implementation Center (CIC) and National Nano Device Laboratories (NDL), was inaugurated in Hsinchu Wednesday.

The merger, which was part of a NARL reshuffle that took place last year, will see TSRI provide integrated circuit (IC) design, tapeout and testing, as well as research and development in semiconductor components, materials and processes.

In addition to talent-training in the semiconductor sector, TSRI plans to ensure that Taiwan's semiconductor technology plays an important role in the fields of both academics and industry.

Science and Technology Minster Chen Liang-gee (陳良基) said the merger is expected to create a better environment for both academics and researchers while assisting in the preparation of future technological progress.

Speaking on his expectations for TSRI, Chen said the institute's supervisors and employees must have the ambition to help Taiwan's semiconductor industry continue to play a leading role in the "fourth industrial revolution."

The "fourth industrial revolution" is marked by emerging technology breakthroughs in a number of fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology that builds on the Digital Revolution, representing new ways that technology can be embedded within society.

Another expectation is that the TSRI will work with other semiconductor-related research institutes and industries, both domestically and abroad, Chen said.

Finally, the TSRI must nurture talent in various ways to enable more young people to recognize the value of the semiconductor industry as a lifelong career, Chen said.
