At the Cabinet's weekly meeting Thursday, Premier Cho Jung-tai received a National Development Council briefing on a plan to promote Taiwan's Five Trusted Industry Sectors. The premier said the plan carries great strategic importance and forms part of the national policy vision outlined by President Lai Ching-te.

Premier Cho said that development of the Five Trusted Industry Sectors—semiconductors, AI, military, security and surveillance, and next-generation communications—will not only strengthen Taiwan's key position in global supply chains and forge closer ties with democratic partners, but will also boost Taiwan's competitiveness across all sectors, create more high-salary employment opportunities, and reinforce the nation's overall security and resilience.

Premier Cho instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, National Science and Technology Council and other relevant ministries and agencies to strengthen their cooperation with industries on semiconductors, AI and drones; accelerate the push toward sovereign AI and complete the related laws and regulations; and enhance R&D into drone technology and strengthen associated technology transfers.
