At the Cabinet's weekly meeting Thursday, Premier Cho Jung-tai received a National Science and Technology Council briefing on a plan to develop next-generation communications technology. The premier said that as 6G and broadband satellite communications gain global momentum, Taiwan should seize this opportunity to build up its next-generation communications technology industry, in line with President Lai Ching-te's policy vision of advancing the Five Trusted Industry Sectors (semiconductors, artificial intelligence, military, security and surveillance, and next-generation communications).

Premier Cho stated that NT$27 billion (approximately US$926.2 million) will be allocated over a six-year period to support the plan, with a focus on three key strategies: deploying critical application services, constructing experimental networks while accelerating technology R&D and trials, and enhancing cross-sector collaborations within the industry ecosystem. The plan will be aligned with the updated third phase of the National Space Technology Long-term Development Program, and will be implemented through a public-private partnership model to build a self-reliant development framework fueled by technology-driven industrial innovation. These efforts aim to deepen international cooperation, strengthen Taiwan's strategic role in the global supply chain and enhance the influence of the nation's next-generation communications industry on international decision-making, thereby positioning Taiwan as a vital and trusted partner in the global democratic community.
