The 38<sup>th</sup> annual Computex show in Taiwan, dubbed Asia’s biggest tech fair, is attempting to capture the growing global trends in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry as it introduces new elements that have attracted great attention lately, namely blockchain and fifth-generation mobile communications ( 5G ).

Various speakers on blockchain and 5G are expected to share their insights and encourage creative thinking so as to assist global technology companies in planning their future markets in a more strategic way, said Walter Yeh, president and CEO of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).

“We want to look at how blockchain technology is applied in different industries,” Yeh said in a press conference on Monday in Taipei, adding that the expo was a “good platform” for ICT companies to grow their businesses.

Aside from the two new technologies, Yeh said the event, held in Taipei from June 5 to 9, would focus on four other topics, namely artificial intelligence, internet of things, gaming and virtual reality as well as innovation and startups.

As startups grew rapidly in the past few years, Yeh said TAITRA continued to hold InnoVEX, a dedicated exhibit area for global startups that would run from June 6 to 8.
