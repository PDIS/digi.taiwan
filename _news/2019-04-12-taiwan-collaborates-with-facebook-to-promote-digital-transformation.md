Vice Premier Chen Chi-mai attended the opening of Facebook’s new office in Taipei on Thursday, thanking and congratulating the tech heavyweight for expanding its operations in Taiwan.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs will collaborate with Facebook on a wide  range of projects, including cross-border e-commerce, talent cultivation and overall technological development. These efforts will make Taiwan and the world a better place, the vice premier said.

Taiwan can provide a rich pool of talent for Facebook to draw on, whether for developing artificial intelligence or expanding augmented and virtual reality technology. Facebook, meanwhile, is expected to attract more global resources to Taiwan, create opportunities for local businesses, and help Taiwan achieve its goal of digital transformation, he added.
