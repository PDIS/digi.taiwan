At the Cabinet's weekly meeting Thursday, Premier Chen Chien-jen received a briefing from the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) on enhanced measures to improve the cultivation of high-tech talent. The premier said the council's proposed additional measures—incentivizing outstanding scientific researchers and assisting doctoral students with their research—will encourage more talented individuals to engage in scientific research, nurturing and expanding a new generation of young researchers with diverse and multidisciplinary capabilities.

High-tech researchers are one of Taiwan's most valuable assets, the premier said. To reinforce the nation's strengths in science and technology, the government will expand investment in the development of key fields including semiconductors, quantum, space, net-zero emissions, age tech and 6G, as well as continue its focus on cultivating domestic talent in science and technology.

The premier directed the NSTC, Ministry of Education, National Development Council and other relevant ministries and agencies to foster a friendly scientific research environment with optimized measures for talent cultivation, recruitment and childbirth, as well as increase the number of women in science and technology, in order to amass talent within key areas of research
