Taiwan is implementing a strategy to leverage its strengths in cost-effective, advanced manufacturing to attain a significant share of the global IoT market. The government has included the technological development of IoT-enabled devices under its 5+2 industrial development plan.

Taiwan possesses an advanced fixed broadband market, with services accessible through a variety of technology platforms including DSL, fibre, Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC), leased lines and wireless. Fibre is the most popular platform and has underpinned Taiwan's relatively high standing in global broadband rankings.

Fibre broadband growth in Taiwan is largely due to the migration of ADSL subscribers to fibre broadband access, attracted to the higher speeds on offer. Growth in overall fibre broadband subscriptions are expected to be subdued.

Taiwan possesses a competitive mobile market comprised of six mobile network operators although the market is dominated by three players. High mobile penetration has resulted in intense competition to gain new subscribers hence the market was quick to embrace 4G LTE.

Taiwan's mobile market is relatively developed compared to other Asian markets and has experienced negative growth over the last five years due to an increasingly saturated market. Flat to very slow growth is predicted over the next five years to 2023. The market will be constrained from higher growth due to a saturated mobile subscriber market and strong local competition.
