Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom has signed an agreement to participate in a multilateral project to lay an undersea cable connecting several countries in Asia in a bid to deepen its international business presence, the company announced on Monday.

The 12,000-kilometer-long Apricot subsea cable system that will feature the state-of-the-art transmission technology will connect Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Guam, according to Chunghwa Telecom.

Slated to be launched in 2024, the Apricot cable system will have a capacity of more than 190 terabits per second to meet the growing demand for access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile broadband networks, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cloud services and video conferencing.

The high-capacity undersea cable is expected to bring high-speed, reliable Internet to Taiwan as it enters the 5G era and will lay the cornerstone for advancing Chunghwa Telecom's cross-border telecom cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and enhance Taiwan's status in the region.

To improve Taiwan's global Internet security, Chunghwa Telecom has been strengthening its links with neighboring countries and important telecom markets in the region by participating in several international undersea cable projects.

It has invested in the construction of the Asia-Pacific Gateway (APG) and the New Cross Pacific (NCP) submarine cable networks, which are both landed at Toucheng, Yilan City.

It is also participating in the construction of the Southeast Asia-Japan 2 (SJC2) undersea cable at Tamsui in New Taipei and Fangshan in Pingtung to enhance Taiwan's national network security. The SJC2 is expected to be completed by 2022.

The Apricot cable features a new router that could link with APG and SJC2 cables through the routers in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Thailand and form a more comprehensive international undersea network in Southeast Asia, according to Wu Hsueh-lan (吳學蘭), president of the company's international business group.

Meanwhile, Google announced on Monday its participation in the construction of the Apricot subsea cable to enhance the flexibility of its Google Cloud and digital services.

Apricot is Googles' latest investment in the global submarine cable area.

The company currently has invested in 18 undersea cables, 27 cloud regions and 82 cloud zones.
