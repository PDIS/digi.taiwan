US and Taiwanese firms have been doing well in cooperative development of tech innovations in 5G, IoT and big data analysis, but it requires more efforts from both sides to facilitate cross-border data flows and enhance privacy protection associated with digital innovations that have ushered in many opportunities and challenges, according to Ian Steff, deputy assistant secretary for manufacturing at the US Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration.

Steff made the remarks when speaking at the 2019 Taiwan-US Digital Economy Forum (DEF) held in Taipei on December 10-11, jointly hosted by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the US, to discuss issues including 5G, AI, IoT, information security, and data economy.

At the forum, AIT director W Brent Christensen said that Taiwan and the US have made major achievements in building reliable semiconductor and ICT supply chains and protecting trade secrets and intellectual properties over the years. He stated that both sides will continue deepening Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF) in developing digital economy and 5G networking services, building talent networks to accelerate bilateral talent exchanges, and reinforcing cooperation between small and medium-size enterprises of both countries.

Heading the Taiwanese delegation, National Development Council (NDC) minister Chen Mei-ling said that through the DEF platform, both countries have been engaged in extensive cooperation in digital trade and investment, innovation startups, smart technologies, cybersecurity, digital inclusiveness and women's economic empowerment, and the US has also been actively helping Taiwan join the Cross-Border Privacy Rules System (CBPR).
