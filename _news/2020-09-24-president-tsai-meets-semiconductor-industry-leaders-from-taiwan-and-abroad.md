On the morning of September 24, President Tsai Ing-wen met with directors and supervisors from SEMI and the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA), as well as other top executives of semiconductor enterprises from home and abroad. The president emphasized that SEMICON Taiwan being held as usual this year despite the pandemic highlights not only Taiwan's achievements in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but also the resilience of our semiconductor sector. She expressed hope that through the concerted efforts of our government and private sectors, the industry will continue to boost competitiveness, and remain a global leader.

A translation of President Tsai's remarks follows:

I attended the SEMICON Taiwan Leadership Gala Dinner with many of you yesterday, and I am delighted to host you today here at the Presidential Office so we can communicate further.

Every year in September, the SEMICON Taiwan international semiconductor exhibition is a major event that receives a lot of attention in Taiwan, as well as global semiconductor industry circles. This year, as we face the challenges of a global pandemic, everyone either holding or participating in this exhibition is putting in a lot of extra effort. To serve international firms that could not come to Taiwan, this year there is a completely new, hybrid physical-virtual exhibit platform to help visitors from around the world overcome travel limitations and access the latest market information. Everyone has worked so hard to overcome existing obstacles for one purpose: to increase the competitiveness and impact of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.

Last Tuesday, under the leadership of SEMI Taiwan President Terry Tsao (曹世綸), SEMI announced the establishment of a high-tech innovation and entrepreneurship platform. During the current SEMICON Taiwan exhibition, SEMI also held a semiconductor matchmaking event to support startup enterprises and help Taiwan enter global markets.

Beginning last month, TSIA Chairman Mark Liu (劉德音) also began his term as this year's global chairman of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC). This year, TSIA also held the WSC annual meeting for the third time, with Chairman Liu taking on great responsibilities, which I am sure will strengthen the Taiwan semiconductor industry's international connections.

I would like to take this opportunity to offer a special thanks to SEMI and TSIA for their contributions, and to all of you for your tremendous efforts to spur overall industry development. Taiwan's semiconductor industry is a key force in global supply chains. We see semiconductors as a critical strategic industry, and will actively assist industry players to resolve difficult problems to continue consolidating domestic semiconductor industry advantages, and even more importantly, accelerating transformation and development.

In my 2020 inauguration speech, I mentioned that our Six Core Strategic Industries include many semiconductor-related industries, which are key industries for our next generation of industrial development and a top priority.

We are addressing the talent issue that everyone is concerned about. Our Executive Yuan, through cooperation among government agencies including the National Development Council, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Ministry of Education, has recently discussed various ways to meet industry needs, including setting up an advanced semiconductor education program, and increasing the number of faculty and students in related academic departments. So wherever you want to go, we will be able to send talent there.

We are also continuing to implement our plan to make Taiwan an advanced manufacturing center for semiconductors. Focal points for future development include the localization of material supplies, boosting technological autonomy, the localization of foreign equipment manufacturing, and increasing domestic production of advanced packaging equipment.

We will implement these initiatives one-by-one to give Taiwan's semiconductor industry more potent technological capabilities and more complete industry supply chains, enhancing our key position in global supply chains.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of SEMI, and its half-century of history makes this an especially significant year. The fact that SEMICON Taiwan was held as usual this year amidst a pandemic highlights not only Taiwan's achievements in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but also the resilience of our semiconductor sector.

Through this exhibition, Taiwan's semiconductor industry provides access to the latest industry trends and market opportunities, promoting international cooperation and exchanges while accelerating the global economic recovery. This is the impact of Taiwan's semiconductor industry. In the future, I hope that through the concerted efforts of our government and private sectors, the industry will continue to boost competitiveness, and remain a leader in the global semiconductor industry.

Also attending the meeting were TSIA Chairman Mark Liu, ASE Technology Holding Company Director and Chief Operating Officer Tien Wu (吳田玉), SEMI Taiwan President Terry Tsao, and Etron Technology Chairman & CEO Nicky Lu (盧超群).
