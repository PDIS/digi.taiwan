To promote the globalization of Taiwan`s industry and promote digital talent transformation, The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), in cooperation with the Industrial Development Bureau, co-hosted the first large-scale Annual Talent Circulation Summit on November 5 at the Nangang Exhibition Center. AIT Director Christensen, Taiwan Vice President Chen, TSMC Founder Morris Chang and Minister of Economic Affairs Shen delivered keynote addresses regarding talent circulation between the United States and Taiwan. Starting next year, talent exchanges with the U.S. will be developed further, and a cross-border talent pool established, featuring highly skilled professionals proficient in digital technology and connected globally. The goal of the talent circulation efforts is to foster 425 talent exchanges within five years to establish our assets in human capital and expand Taiwan international presence in the process.  

More than 30 internationally renowned leaders and experts are invited to discuss talent circulation and digital transformation. More than 1,200 participants joined the summit.

Minister Jong-Chin Shen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that The Talent Circulation Alliance (TCA) is a public-private partnership that facilitates the circulation of talent between Taiwan and like-minded partners. It will bring together global leaders in the public and private sectors including the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), American Chamber of Commerce, National Development Council, Ministry of Science and Technology, and Ministry of Education to promote talent circulation together. The talent circulation expected to develop the most important talent assets in a five-year period to showcase Taiwan success in this area. The alliance between the United States and Taiwan, now in its first phase, will attract other like-minded countries from all over the world to enhance Taiwan talent assets, drive economic growth, upgrade the industry, and enhance Taiwan international influence.
