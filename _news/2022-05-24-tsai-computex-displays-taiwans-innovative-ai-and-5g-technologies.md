President Tsai Ing-wen highlighted Taiwan’s innovative capabilities at the opening of Computex, one of the world’s largest computer trade shows, on Tuesday.

Tsai says that the exhibition features AI computing, 5G applications, biomedicine, smart manufacturing and more. She says Taiwan is not only a leader in high-end hardware, but also in providing diverse and innovative services. 

Economic minister Wang Mei-hua says the microchip industry faces many uncertainties due to the Russian-Ukraine War, China’s lockdown and inflation.

Despite these challenges, President Tsai says Taiwan is still confident. She added Taiwan will continue to create new innovations and play a key role in global supply chains. 

Tsai also says she hopes the government and industry will continue to work together to promote digital development plans to make Taiwan a leader in technology.

This year’s theme is Building Global Technology Ecosystems.  Computex runs from Tuesday to Friday at the Nangang Exhibition Center in Taipei.
