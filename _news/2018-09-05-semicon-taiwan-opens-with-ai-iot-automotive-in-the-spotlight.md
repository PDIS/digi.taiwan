Semiconductor industry growth drivers artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive take center stage as more than 45,000 visitors gather at SEMICON Taiwan starting today. Showcasing the latest developments and innovations in the microelectronics supply chain, SEMICON Taiwan – September 5-7, at the Taipei Nanang Convention Center – is the largest semiconductor supply chain event in Taiwan. The event opens with Taiwan’s semiconductor industry revenue poised to grow 6 percent to $84.76 billion U.S. dollars ($2.6 trillion NT dollars) in 2018.

Taiwan leads the world in semiconductor foundry, package and test services and is second in chip design. SEMICON Taiwan features more than 2,000 booths and 680 exhibitors from around the world.

SEMICON Taiwan 2018’s IC 60 – Master Forum, a special event co-organized by SEMI and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), celebrates the 60th anniversary of the birth of the integrated circuit. With their sights set on emerging opportunities, Taiwan semiconductor industry luminaries will highlight the pioneering spirit and tenacious pursuit of smaller, faster, lower-power devices that gave rise to today’s ICs and are the heart of the digital economy.

Premier of Executive Yuan, Ching-de Lai will speak at today’s opening ceremony to highlight the administration’s support for the sustainable growth of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. Semiconductor heavyweights, academic professionals, and other officials – all key players in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry – are also expected at the ceremony.

With semiconductor processes ramping to the 5nm technology and below and novel techniques such as heterogeneous integration ushering in improvements to chip functionality, SEMICON Taiwan is the ideal platform for connecting, collaborating and innovating to take advantage of future opportunities.

New show floor features at SEMICON Taiwan include the Smart Manufacturing Journey to highlight future trends and opportunities in smart semiconductor manufacturing and the Smart Workforce Pavilion, which promotes the development of the semiconductor industry talent pipeline. In addition, 22 theme and regional pavilions and a series of forums and networking events spotlight market trends and cutting-edge technologies and open opportunities for cross-field and cross-region collaboration.

“Semiconductors are the backbone of the Taiwan’s economic growth and its leadership position in the global semiconductor industry,” said Terry Tsao, president of SEMI Taiwan. “As critical partners, Taiwan policy makers continue to work closely with the industry and will propose a series of reforms across tax, trade, talent, and technology to enrich the region’s investment climate and encourage industry upgrades.”

“Taiwan is in a strong position to help power future semiconductor industry growth with its highly specialized, fully integrated supply chains and years of management experience,” Tsao said. “Taiwan will long remain a key strategic player in the global semiconductor industry.”
