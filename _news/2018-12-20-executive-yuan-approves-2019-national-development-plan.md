The Executive Yuan on Thursday approved the 2019 National Development Plan proposed by the National Development Council to grow Taiwan’s overall economy by 2.4 to 2.6 percent next year.

Premier Lai Ching-te said the plan also aims to hold the consumer price index growth rate to no more than 2 percent while maintaining unemployment at 3.6 to 3.7 percent in 2019. These goals factor in domestic and global economic trends as well as aggressive measures by the government. He instructed government agencies to strive toward the objectives by implementing the plan’s policy measures thoroughly.

The plan is built on four main pillars: a secure and prosperous working and living environment, sustainable population growth, balanced regional growth, and national security and global engagement. These efforts cover new priorities for next year as well as continued policies for supporting the nation’s growth, the premier said.

Several key performance indicators (KPI) have also been identified to ensure the progress of major policies, he continued. Two new cross-agency KPIs, smart governance and regional revitalization, highlight the government’s focus on strengthening the competitiveness of Taiwan’s digital economy and balancing development across all regions.

To build a smart government that relies on data and uses the latest technologies to improve the quality of decision-making processes, agencies should take advantage of big-data analytics to gain insights into new trends, prescribe the right policies, and proactively respond to emerging issues. These efforts will strengthen the public’s confidence in the government, Premier Lai said.
