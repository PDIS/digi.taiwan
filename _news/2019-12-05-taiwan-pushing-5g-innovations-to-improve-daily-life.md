At the Cabinet's weekly meeting Thursday, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Taiwan should get an early jump on 5G technology and artificial intelligence (AI) as these star industries of the future are being driven by society's needs. The premier already approved a four-year, NT$20.5 billion (US$672 million) nationwide action plan this May to transform Taiwan into an environment for innovative 5G applications.

The premier's remarks followed a briefing by the Executive Yuan's Office of Science and Technology (OST) on Taiwan's 5G spectrum policy and dedicated network development.

The National Communications Commission (NCC) is currently conducting the first round of 5G spectrum release for commercial use, Premier Su said. Auctions will begin December 10, with the license release to be completed next January. He asked the NCC to exercise the utmost care for this round of license issuance as Taiwan prepares to enter the era of 5G wireless technology.

Beyond telecommunications, 5G tech harbors great potential for smart technologies including AI, the internet of things, and cybersecurity, the premier continued. Public and private sectors alike can develop useful innovations and applications.

To encourage even more enterprises across all industries to take part, the government has already reserved spectrum in the 4.8 to 4.9 gigahertz range for corporate network use, said the premier. These dedicated channels will operate independently to help ensure high-quality communications and data security. Applications for these channels are now being accepted, so that businesses may begin field testing in preparation for license issuance between 2021 and 2022.

The OST indicated that in addition to commercial use, Taiwan and other countries such as Germany, Japan and the U.K. are all designing mechanisms for the development of dedicated networks. The aim is to encourage innovative applications like remote medicine for rural seniors, smart neighborhood security, and industrial safety-enhancing smart manufacturing.
