A communication service and software research team of Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) has introduced an open-source 5G core (5GC) network, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).

Leveraging the 5GC technology, the research term has set up a startup under a MOST value-creating initiative which will focus on developing solutions for vertical applications of designated 5G networks in cooperation with Chunghwa Telecom (CHT).

The open-source 5GC network developed by the NCTU team complies with SBA (Service Based Architecture) defined in 3GPP Release 15 (R15). The team has also introduced a version enabling 5G IP TV applications and network slicing.

The free 5GC network software enables 5G communications on any hardware platforms reducing telecom operators' reliance on equipment from Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei, and can facilitate the development of the 5G network market, said Chen Chih-chen, head of the team.

In addition to cooperation with CHT, the startup will also collaborate with network device maker Wistron NeWeb and SDN solution provider EstiNet Technologies to develop related 5G solutions.
