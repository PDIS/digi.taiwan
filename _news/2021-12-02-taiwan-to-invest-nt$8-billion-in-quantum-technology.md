At the Cabinet's weekly meeting Thursday, Premier Su Tseng-chang received a briefing from the Ministry of Science and Technology on its deployment strategy for new-generation quantum technology. Quantum computers are regarded as the computing tools for the next generation, and the technology required for it matches the strengths of Taiwan's tech industries. From 2022 to 2026, the government plans to invest NT$8 billion (US$288.2 million) to create an industry cooperation platform, which will allow Taiwan to play a leading role among new-generation quantum technology competitors and create the next semiconductor miracle.

As the premier pointed out, quantum computers are regarded as the computing tools for the next generation. If combined with quantum computing, their powerful parallel computing capabilities can be used with artificial intelligence and big data analytics to shape a smart society for the future. Quantum technology is expected to have a revolutionary impact on numerous levels of applications including cybersecurity, financial technology, industry, transportation and national defense. World governments and tech heavyweights like IBM, Google and Microsoft are therefore investing heavily in capital and manpower to conduct quantum science and related R&D in order to seize early advantages in the field.

The core of quantum computing is hardware, the premier said, but quantum chips are the foundation. The technology required for quantum computing aligns with Taiwan's existing high-tech industry strengths in chip manufacturing processes, peripheral cables and packaging technology, and Academia Sinica already has the relevant technologies. This gives Taiwan an excellent opportunity to develop quantum technology, and we should make the most of that opportunity.

Premier Su emphasized that this year, the government already launched a cross-agency plan to upgrade Taiwan's hardware, software and development capabilities for quantum technology. To do that, the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Academia Sinica have teamed up to form a Quantum Taiwan team. Over the next five years, they will invest NT$8 billion for collaborative quantum technology R&D by industry, academia and research institutions, and to set up an industry cooperation platform. Academia Sinica will also establish a quantum research base in the Shalun Science Park in Tainan to integrate hardware, software and personnel development efforts so that Taiwan can address the challenges of the new quantum era and continue to play a key role in core quantum technologies and quantum technology applications.
