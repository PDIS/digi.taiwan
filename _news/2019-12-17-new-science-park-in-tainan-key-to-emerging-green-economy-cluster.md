Taiwan reached a new milestone in green technology Monday with the opening of Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City (SGESC), the nation's first science park incorporating technology, nature and culture. The campus will take the lead in remaking the city of Tainan into a capital of new-era technology, enabling Taiwan to join the ranks of Asia's advanced technology research and development nations. The SGESC will also serve as the nucleus of an emerging green economy cluster by tying together the many neighboring science and industrial parks to form an overarching ecosystem for innovative green energy businesses.

Vice Premier Chen Chi-mai said that the SGESC is a key component of President Tsai Ing-wen's "five plus two" innovative industries plan. As future demand drives innovation, and innovation transforms industry, the Shalun science city will function as a base for experimental research and industrial research and development, spurring the development of high-tech industry and smart technology services throughout southern Taiwan.

The SGESC will draw on the successful experience of Startup Terrace in northern Taiwan's Linkou district to attract tenants such as accelerators, incubators, large multinational corporations, and leading research teams, the vice premier said. With the added innovative power of incoming green energy and smart services startups, development in the southern Shalun green energy zone will surge and propel the rise of a green economy cluster in Taiwan.
