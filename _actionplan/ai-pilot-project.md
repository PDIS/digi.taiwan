# Adopt models similar to DARPA in the US and SIP in Japan in order to focus research and discover niche advantages for development.

* The R&D topics and objectives are specified by the “Expert Review Board on Scientific Research Plans” and execution teams are selected publicly

* Enterprises, legal entities, universities and professional communities are invited to team-up for competition; project investigators and research teams will be carefully chosen

* International R&D teams are welcomed to join the competition

* “End point” efficiency will be seriously considered along with practicing “milestone reviews.” 

# Develop the National AI Forward-looking Research Network

* Incorporate relevant university AI programs with more teachers and students, as well as develop diversified talent training models to attract potential elites to pursue advanced degrees

* Integrate with the international community to attract global elites
