## **VISION**

### To accelerate Industrial Innovation, to create Smart Nation

Aligning with the national policy directory “Digital Nation, Smart Island,” the Taiwanese government has promoted the “Digital Nation & Innovative Economic Development Program (DIGI<sup>+</sup>) 2017-2025,” which is intended to enhance digital infrastructure, re-construct a service-based digital government, and realize a fair and active internet society with equal digital rights. In addition, innovative cross-boundary digital applications can be initialized with solid digital infrastructures, not only to further drive industry to adopt digital development, but also to promote the smart city concept and bridge the digital divide in rural areas.
